# Suggestions from TAs


1. As a small comment on the grading procedure. I think our
   performance will increase if there was a link on the canvas current
   submission sheet that directly created a new issue on the gitlab repo
   with the handlers for the students in the comments part and the title
   already partially filled in Grading for.


2. All labs should have some automatic tests:
   Maybe for next iteration there should be, I am grading a group
   whose code doesn't compile and is a bit hard to spot by just
   looking. (They use medianOfThree with three arguments not four)
