These scripts were written for lab grading in DAT038/TDA417 in 2020 LP2.
This was the last instance of a data structure course in the cluster of this repository that used Canvas for managing submissions.
We moved to submission managed using Chalmers GitLab afterwards.

Some parts of these scripts have been extracted and generalized:
* The live submission table in lab_assignment has been turned into a stand-alone module in the parent directory.

Other parts might be extracted and generalized in the future:
* The compression modules: `compression`, `dir_glob`, `zip_and_share`.
* The feedback collection script: `get_feedback`, `get_feedback_helpers`.
* Some statistics functions in `lab_statistics`.
