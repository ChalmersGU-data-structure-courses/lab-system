Idea.
Write needed student user information into grading merge request.
That way, the lab system does not rely on Canvas information for this when processing submissions.

For graders user information, we can rely on user profile information on Chalmers GitLab.

What happens if a user gets added manually to a lab project?
The next time we sync Canvas â†’ GitLab, the system can use placeholder user information.

This decouples the ordinary operation of the lab system from Canvas.
The responsibility for creating and configuring lab projects probably still belongs the lab system.

So it should react to the following events:
* create (delete?) a lab project
* handle a submission, grading, test request

Tasks:
* Add cache for resolving personnummer to CID via PDB
* Add cache for users on Chalmers GitLab
* Add submission handling in merge request in same project.
* Better webhook management.
  - Regularly check for their status?
  - Check status if update is found while polling?
